    \section*{Abstract}
    Searching spatial data is an important operation for scientific simulations
    which are performed mostly on periodic boundary conditions.
    An R-Tree is a widely used tree data structure to contain spatial objects and
    it is capable of answering to spatial searching queries in an efficient way.
    In this paper, I propose a novel method to construct R-Tree according to
    periodic boundary conditions by introducing a set of operations for
    rectangles.
    Unlike existing methods, this method works without any kind of additional
    copies of objects or queries.
    Moreover, because this method reduces the size of bounding boxes for each
    nodes of R-Tree in the natural way in the conditions, it is expected to
    increase the efficiency of processing spatial queries.
    The method can essentially be applied not only to the Guttman's original
    R-Tree but also to other data structures or algorithms if they use rectangles
    on periodic boudary conditions. The implementation is available on GitHub.

\section*{Introduction}

Computational simulations are essential tools for scientific research, such as
investigating behaviors of complex biochemical models. To perform such a large
scale simulation, both huge amount of computational resources and efficient
simulation softwares are required.

In most cases, searching for objects that satisfy some geometrical conditions
is one of the most costly operation in the simulation. Generally, an efficient
method for spatial search drastically accelerates not only the whole simulation
processes, but also the data analysis of simulation results. Therefore, a method
that efficiently processes spatial search accelerates whole process of scientific
simulation research.

An R-Tree is a widely used data structure representing bounding volume
hierarchies (BVH) by using axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) for all its entries
\cite{Guttman1984}. It is capable of containing both sizeless and finite sized
objects such as points, segments, spheres and etc. As its efficiency, many
variants have been proposed and are applied for many problems in a broad range
of fields.

In order to use it with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs), currently,
two methods are proposed (figure\ref{fig-method-rtree-pbc})\cite{CoSTR-R-tree2016}.
The method that is visually described in figure \ref{fig-method-rtree-pbc}A
periodically copies all the objects in the simulation system along each dimension.
Although it can search objects associated with the adjacent periodic images in
the same way as normal R-Tree, it consumes memory $3^D$ fold a lot (here $D$
reprecents a number of dimension).
Figure \ref{fig-method-rtree-pbc}B showes another method copies not the whole
system but a query in the same manner if the query goes outside of the boundary.
Although it works completely fine with sizeless particles, it has a limitation on
containing finite-sized objects. It might overlook objects if query is not copied
when it is inside of the boundary and objects extend beyond the unit cell
(figure\ref{fig-method-rtree-pbc}C).

Here I propose the novel method to apply PBCs to an R-Tree. The main idea is
applying the PBCs to each operations for AABBs that are performed in each step
to maintain an R-Tree. By allowing an AABB corresponding to each node to extend
along PBCs, an R-Tree become capable of containing objects in the most natural
way on PBCs and overcoming the limitation of containing finite-sized object
(figure\ref{fig-method-rtree-pbc}D).
With this method, it is not needed to copy objects or queries at all.
Moreover, using the information about the boundary condition, it has more chance
to reduce the AABBs of each node. Since the efficiency of spatial searching on
an R-Tree is strongly affected by the size of each nodes, this feature increase
the efficiency of spatial searching in some cases.

    can manage objects that are associated with periodic images.

    detect objects that are beyond boundary.
    (\textbf{C})
    With the method described in \textbf{B}, finite sized objects could be
    overlooked when queries that is inside of the boundary are not copied.

    the periodicity, R-Tree can organize objects on periodic boundary
    conditions.}

\section*{Methods}

Here I introduce some operations to modify and handle rectangles on PBCs.
I do not modify the algorithm to grow and maintain an R-Tree at all.
Hence, in this setion, I do not show algorithm to construct R-Tree itself.
It means that this method can potentially be applied for some of the R-Tree
variants and the other spatial indexing methods that is based on BVH and
uses AABBs.

Because the rectangles used in R-Tree are axis-aligned, it is enough to show an
operation for one dimension to provide the whole algorithm.
Applying it to each dimensions successively, these operations can be extended
straightforwardly for higher dimension cases.

\paragraph{Representation of PBCs.}
For simplicity, I consider only cuboids as an unit cell of the PBCs.
Here, all the coordinates of objects are restricted to inside of the unit cell.
There are well-known alrogithm to restrict coordinates and vectors to the unit cell.
In this paper, I call them as \textbf{RestrictPosition} and
\textbf{RestrictVector}, respectively.

\paragraph{Representation of AABBs.}
There are three common representations for AABBs
~\cite{real-time-collision-detection} \ref{fig-rectangle-rep}.
The first one is a pair of the minimum and maximum coordinate values
in each dimension. The second one is a pair of the minimum coordinate values and
its width in each dimension. The third one is a pair of the center position and
half-width in each dimension. Here, I call it as min-max, min-widths, and
center-radius representation, respectively.

Because the method proposed in this paper quite often uses center position of
an AABB, here I employ an center-radius representation.

\begin{equation}
    rectangle = \{center, radius\}
\end{equation}

Needless to say, all the representations have identical information, one can
convert one representation to another. By algorithm\ref{center_aabb} and
\ref{radius_aabb}, one can easily convert the min-max representation to
the center-radius representation. It should be noted that a maximum coordinate
value might be smaller than the corresponding minimum coordinate value because
all the coordinates are restricted to inside of the unit cell.

    \begin{algorithmic}
        \State $U \gets$ maximum coordinate values of an AABB
        \State $L \gets$ minimum coordinate values of an AABB
        \State $B \gets$ the unit cell of a boundary
        \Function{CentroidAABB}{$U, L, B$}
            \If{$U < L$}
                \State $C \gets (U + B.width + L) / 2$
            \Else
                \State $C \gets (U + L) / 2$
            \EndIf
            \State \Return $C$
        \EndFunction

        \State $B \gets$ the unit cell of a boundary
        \Function{WidthAABB}{$U, L, B$}
            \If{$U < L$}
                \State $W \gets U + B.width - L$
            \Else
                \State $W \gets U - L$
            \EndIf
            \State \Return $W$
        \EndFunction
     \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Expanding AABBs on PBCs.}
Expanding an AABB to ensure it contains a new contents is one of the most
important operations in an R-Tree algorithms.
Because the total area that is covered by AABBs in the nodes of an R-Tree
affects the efficiency of spatial searching, it is needed to find the way to
make the area of rectangle in each node as small as possible.

The algorithm to find the minimum expansion of AABB to contain another AABB on
PBCs is shown in algorithm ~\ref{expand_aabb_aabb}.
The size of bounding box that contains two rectangles is determined by the
distance between their center points because of the symmetry of a rectangule.
Therefore, by minimizing the distance between their centroids, the minimum
expansion can be found. To minimize the distance between two points on PBCs,
the \textbf{RestrictVector} can be used.

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{expand AABB so that it contains another AABB}
    \label{expand_aabb_aabb}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \State $R1 \gets$ AABB to be expanded
        \State $R2 \gets$ rectangle to be contained
        \State $B  \gets$ boundary
        \Function{ExpandAABB}{$R1, R2, B$}
            \State $dc \gets R2.center - R1.center$
            \State $dc \gets$ \Call{RestrictVector}{dc, B}

            \State $l1 \gets R1.center - R1.radius$
            \State $u1 \gets R1.center + R1.radius$
            \State $l2 \gets (R1.center + dc) - R2.radius$
            \State $u2 \gets (R1.center + dc) + R2.radius$

            \State $L  \gets \Call{min}{l1, l2}$
            \State $U  \gets \Call{max}{u1, u2}$
            \State $C  \gets (L + U) / 2$
            \State $HW \gets (U - L) / 2$
            \State $C  \gets$ \Call{RestrictPosition}{C, B}

            \State \Return $\{C, HW\}$
        \EndFunction
     \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

For the case of a point, it become simpler as described in the algorithm
~\ref{expand_aabb_point}. By minimizing the distance between centroid of the
rectangle and the point to be contained, the minimum expansion can be found.

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{expand AABB so that it contains a point}
    \label{expand_aabb_point}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \State $R \gets$ AABB to be expanded
        \State $P \gets$ point to be contained
        \State $B \gets$ boundary
        \Function{ExpandAABB}{$R, P, B$}
            \State $dc \gets P - R.center$
            \State $dc \gets$ \Call{RestrictVector}{dc, B}

            \State $l \gets R.center - R.radius$
            \State $u \gets R.center + R.radius$

            \State $L  \gets \Call{min}{l, P}$
            \State $U  \gets \Call{max}{u, P}$
            \State $C  \gets (L + U) / 2$
            \State $HW \gets (U - L) / 2$

            \State $C \gets$ \Call{RestrictPosition}{C, B}
            \State \Return $\{C, HW\}$
        \EndFunction
     \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Detecting an object includes or intersects the other object}

To find an object in an R-Tree, the algorithm is needed to check whether an
rectangle intersects or be inside of another rectangle.
It also can be determined by using the minimum distance between centroids of the
rectangles.
The algorithm for the center-radius representation can be applied after
restricting the inter center points vector.

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Check whether an AABB is inside of an AABB}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \State $R1 \gets$ rectangle
        \State $R2 \gets$ rectangle that might be inside of R1
        \State $B  \gets$ boundary
        \Function{IsAABBInsideOfAABB}{$R1, R2, B$}
            \State $dc \gets R1.center - R2.center$
            \State $dc \gets$ \Call{RestrictVector}{dc, B}

            \State \Return \Call{abs}{dc} $\leq (R1.radius - R2.radius)$
        \EndFunction
     \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}

    \begin{algorithmic}
        \State $R \gets$ rectangle
        \State $P \gets$ point that might be inside of R
        \State $B \gets$ boundary
        \Function{IsPointInsideOfAABB}{$R, P, B$}
            \State $dc \gets R.center - P$
            \State $dc \gets$ \Call{RestrictVector}{dc, B}
            \State \Return \Call{abs}{dc} $\leq R.radius$
        \EndFunction
     \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Check whether an AABB intersects to another AABB}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \State $R1 \gets$ rectangle
        \State $R2 \gets$ rectangle that might intersect to R1
        \State $B  \gets$ boundary
        \Function{IntersectsAABB}{$R1, R2, B$}
            \State $dc \gets R.center - R.center$
            \State $dc \gets$ \Call{RestrictVector}{dc, B}
            \State \Return \Call{abs}{dc} $\leq (R1.radius + R2.radius)$
        \EndFunction
     \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section*{Conclusion}

In this paper, the novel method for applying PBCs to Guttman's R-Tree is
introduced. Proposed method is capable of containing not only sizeless points
but also objects with finite size. The method can remove the necessity of
storing extensional objects or replicating queries. Moreover, it reduces the
size of each node in the natural way on PBCs.

On the other hand, the method introduces tiny but additional costs into each
procedures for maintaining R-Tree and checking geometrical conditions because it
considers the PBCs for all of the procedure. It might decrease the efficiency of
the R-Tree in some case.

As described before, since the method is only for modifying and handling
rectangles on PBCs, it can essentially be applied for the other R-Tree variants
or the other kind of spatial indexing methods.

Because the adaptation of spatial indexing to a system on PBCs has a chance to
accelerate many kind of sientific simulations, it is expected that this novel
method will have an important role for the simulations that will be performed in
the next decade.
